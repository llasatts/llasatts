输入文本: Deep into that darkness peering, Long I stood there, wondering, fearing, Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals. Ever dared to dream before; But the silence was unbroken, And the stillness gave no token, And the only word there spoken. Was the whispered word, "Lenore!" This I whispered, and an echo. Murmured back the word, "Lenore!" Merely this, and nothing more.
